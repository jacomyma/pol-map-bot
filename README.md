# pol-map-bot
 Twitter bot

# Install

```
npm install
```

Then, rename ```default.env``` into ```.env``` and edit its content with your settings:
* ```DATA_SOURCE_FOLDER``` is the path to the ```data``` folder where ```twitter-carto``` saves the source data.
* ```DATA_ARCHIVE_FOLDER``` is the path where tweeted stuff is stored for archival (not public).
* ```DATA_PUBLIC_FOLDER``` is the path where public data is put (the idea is to make it public, for instance via ```pol-map-fr-public```)
